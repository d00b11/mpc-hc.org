title: v1.7.8 is released
---

After 3 months since our last stable build, we are happy to announce v1.7.8.

<!--more-->

This release is a bugfix release, with many improvements and a few new features.

Highlights of this release:

* Improved DVB playback mode and compatibility
* Support RTMP streams with librtmp style parameters
* Many stability fixes (subtitles, renderers, etc)
* New Finnish and Serbian translations. Remember that you can [help us](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/Translations)
  translating MPC-HC to your language.

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
[are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/).
Be aware of scams and only get the files from our site!

Also, to report bugs, suggestions and generally provide feedback, use our [Trac](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/);
reporting anything on social media or in any other place is just pointless, as the developers only follow Trac.

You can download the new version [here](/downloads/).
For the complete changes see the [changelog](/changelog/).
