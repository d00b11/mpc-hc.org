title: Website moved to Jekyll
---

We have decided to move the website's source to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

<!--more-->

Jekyll is used widely by many people who want a customizable static page generator.
It generally works much better than the previous solution.

End users and visitors shouldn't see much of a difference though,
apart from the proper [RSS feed](/rss.xml) and [sitemap](/sitemap.xml).

Remember, the website's source is open too, you can fork the repository
and submit pull requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc.org).
